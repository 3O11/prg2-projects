# prg2-projects
Projects written for the Programming 2 course at MFF UK
(Course link: https://gamedev.cuni.cz/study/courses-history/courses-2020-2021/labs-for-programming-2-summer-202021/).
In some of these projects, parts of the code are not my own,
they were provided to me by my teacher.
Also, in most of these projects, the class design or at least the very basic outline was
not thought up by me, it was provided by my teacher.

# Projects

This is a list of projects that are, in my opinion, worth sharing.
They are listed in chronoligical order in which I'm implementing them.

### GameBook-1

A tiny GameBook engine.
It reads a plain-text file that follows a very loosely defined set of rules and
then allows the user to play the game that was saved in that file.
Most of the actual driver code was supplied to me by the teacher.
(In the future, I'll fill in what part was my own code)
It was imported finished because it was written before this repository existed.

### Calculator

Small extensible calculator written from a pre-made UML Class Diagram,
which was extended by Store/Load Memory operators.
It was also imported finished because it was written before this repository existed.

### Hamurabi

An economic simulation game ported over from BASIC.
The point was to implement logic that made the simulator work as a
simulator of simulation games.
It is practical for these types of games.

### GameBook-2

This is an extension of the first GameBook program,
in this assignment, the point was to make the gamebook "play itself".

### Snake

Snake game implemented from a UML class diagram, with a few modifications/extensions
that I felt made sense.

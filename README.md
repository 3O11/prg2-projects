# prg2-projects
Projects written for the Programming 2 course at MFF Cuni led by.
In some of these projects, parts of the code are not my own,
they were provided to me by my teacher, those projects will specifically mention that
not all of the code is my own.
Also, in most of these projects, the class design or at least the very basic outline was
not thought up by me, it was provided by my teacher.

# Projects

This is a list of projects that are, in my opinion, worth sharing.
They are listed in chronoligical order in which I'm implementing them.

### GameBook-1

A tiny GameBook engine.
It reads a plain-text file that follows a very loosely defined set of rules and
then allows the user to play the game that was saved in that file.
Most of the actual driver code was supplied to me by the teacher.
(In the future, I'll fill in what part was my own code)
It was imported finished because it was written before this repository existed.

### Calculator

Small extensible calculator written from a pre-made UML Class Diagram,
which was extended by Store/Load Memory operators.
It was also imported finished because it was written before this repository existed.

### Snake

Currently just a stub that is implemented from a pre-made UML Class Diagram.
The actual implementation will follow.
